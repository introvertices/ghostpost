Python based messenger with no tracking, logging, or signups

## function:
This is a messenger based on old school IRC. No passwords, no 2FA, no tracking you, no logging. Pick a username, pick a room name, and talk to your friends.

The principle behind this is to treat messaging as similarly to an IRL conversation as possible. YOU hold all accountability for your security and what you say, not another company. Everything is erased when all people leave a room, and unless someone is willing to sit there screenshotting everything there are no logging tools.

## installation:
Requires Tkinter (pip install tkinter) and PIL (pip install pillow).
Includes php files and instructions for hosting on your own SQL server if you want to (preferable, for your own security)


# THIS IS A WIP

##To-do list:
- Add admin privileges
- Add admin commands
- UX stuff
- Probably other things
